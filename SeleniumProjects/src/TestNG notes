@AfterMethod

@AfterTest
@AfterSuite

we can set priority 
we can set group

@Test(priority=1)
@Test(group="login")

@Test(DependsOnMethod="login test")----if one is dependedent on some another test and that fails this test won't run.

@Test(invocationCount=2)-- if we want to run a program multiple times

@Test(invocationTimeOut=2)--it will stop executing in 2 miliseconds.

@Test(expectedException=numberFormatException.class) --if an exception is expected, then also it will pass the test case.
without try catch we can handle exception by expectedException keyword of TestNG.

Assert class has many methods to compare expected and actual values.

we create a template filew for TestNG
testng.xml
a format is there
